  <h1>The History of Coffee and Mug</h1>
  <h2>
    The histories of coffee and the mug are deeply linked, each evolving to shape a daily ritual cherished worldwide.
    Coffee's story begins with a 9th-century Ethiopian legend about a goat herder named Kaldi, whose energetic goats led
    to the discovery of coffee's stimulating effects. The drink soon spread across the Arabian Peninsula, where
    coffeehouses (qahveh khaneh) emerged as lively social spaces. As coffee spread to Persia, Turkey, and eventually
    Europe, it sparked a cultural phenomenon, with coffeehouses becoming centers for conversation and community.
    <br>
    <br>
    The mug's history goes back even further. Early mugs from around 4000 BCE were made of wood and bone, and over time,
    more durable materials like clay, bronze, and glass emerged. As coffee became popular in Europe in the 17th century,
    the need for sturdy mugs grew. The Industrial Revolution brought mass-produced ceramic mugs, making them widely
    available and perfect for the coffee experience. By the 20th century, the mug became a personal item, from
    decorative designs to functional travel cups.
    <br>
    <br>
    Today, coffee and mugs are inseparable, bringing comfort and connection to people around the world. This simple
    pairing, rooted in centuries of tradition, continues to link cultures and generations, making the humble mug of
    coffee a shared, timeless ritual.
